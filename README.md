# Prompt Engineering Model for Correcting Job Titles and Extracting Departments

This repository contains a Python application that leverages Prompt's engineering model to correct job titles and extract departments from a database. The application is built using Python, Streamlit, and multithreading for efficient processing.

## About

The engineering model utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques from OpenAI's API to correct and standardize job titles and extract relevant department information from textual data. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where job titles vary widely or are inconsistently labeled across datasets.

## Features

1. **Job Title Correction:** The model corrects misspelled or inconsistent job titles to a standardized format, improving data consistency and accuracy.

2. **Department Extraction:** Utilizing NLP from the OpenAI API, the model extracts department information from job titles or descriptions, providing insights into organizational structures and workforce composition.

3. **Efficient Processing:** Multithreading is employed to optimize performance, allowing for fast processing of large datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core logic of the application is implemented in Python, a powerful and versatile programming language.
- **Streamlit:** Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the engineering model.
- **OpenAI API:** OpenAI's API is used for natural language processing tasks such as text correction and entity extraction.
- **Multithreading:** Python's threading module is employed to achieve parallel processing and improve overall performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Install Dependencies:**
3. **Configure Database Connection:**
- Update the database connection settings in the configuration file to point to your database.

4. **Obtain OpenAI API Key:**
- Sign up for an account on OpenAI's platform and obtain an API key.
- Set up the API key in the configuration file of the application.

5. **Run the Application:**
6. 
The Streamlit application should now be accessible in your web browser. You can upload datasets containing job titles or descriptions to correct job titles and extract department information using the OpenAI API.

## Usage

1. **Upload Data:** Upload a dataset containing job titles or descriptions in CSV or Excel format.

2. **Select Processing Options:** Choose the desired processing options, such as job title correction and department extraction.

3. **Run the Model:** Initiate the processing of the uploaded data. Progress updates and results will be displayed in real-time.

4. **Review Results:** Once processing is complete, review the corrected job titles and extracted department information.
